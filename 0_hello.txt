this is the starting of the new chapter...or rather say new phase of me learning JS

after getting large code files from harshit Vashishth and understanding beauty of this language from Akshay bhai

I am here to start the final lap of my journey to the: "JS mastrey",

and this time my mentor is none other than Harry bhai.

He has created a beautiful playlist of "ultimate JS tutorial" of lenght 98 videos and 2 major prooject at the end.

so I will take around 20 to 25 days to complete it and another 5 days to wrap the projects


but there is a major challnage exist for this playlist to complete which is: 

1. my university viva exam and final exam is coming
2. I also have to cover the React.js form meta plateform which is around 1 month


So, these are the 2 major problems is there but if I am somehow able to manage all of these 3 things together then next phase will be cakewalk.


I am certain that before "21 APRIL" I would be established web3 devloper and succesful freelancer/an intern at a sexy place.

kyuki last year me ladhkh bhi to jana hai ;-)

So hope things are gonna gettin in right place for you as well as for me.

Happy Coding!!!
